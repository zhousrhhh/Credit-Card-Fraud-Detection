# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Every year billions of dollars are lost in the US due to credit card fraud. Thus, forcing financial institutions to continuously improve their fraud detection systems. In recent years, machine learning and data mining techniques are being used to address this problem.
> Objectives:
> 1. The first report uses a real dataset to conduct the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering (FE) process for credit card fraud detection. The main objective is to create some useful features, that can capture the consumer spending patterns and detect the anomalities. With the anomalities detected, we can further investigate the specific transactions and make potential fraud alerts.
> 2. The second report uses a real dataset to conduct credit card fraud detection. I will use unsupervised learning methods (HBOS and ECOD) to revise the features and identify anomalous credit card transactions.

> Dataset: The dataset contains information on purchases made through the purchase card programs administered by the state and higher education institutions in the State of Oklahoma. It includes both the raw data fields and new variables created by the previous feature engineering process.
